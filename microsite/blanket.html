            The inflatables questioned the standard tenets of building in the late '60s and early '70s : these were structures with no fixed form and could not be described in the usual architectural representations of plan and section. They instead promoted a type of architecture that moved away from a reliance on expert knowledge.<br><br>
            Just like that, the designer of this exhibition questioned the standard tenets of disaster preparedness. Although massive efforts have been contributed to disseminate the recommended preparedness, there is only a small proportion of population well-prepared for disasters such as floods and earthquakes. The designer applied inflatables in furniture and clothes. The inflatable structure will automatically response to disasters. In this way, people are released from the preparedness and have a bigger chance to survive.<br><br><br><br><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Go Back</a>
